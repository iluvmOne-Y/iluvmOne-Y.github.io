So, I went to the cinema to watch a movie all by myself. Weirdo, right?
**But...** actually, I think everyone should do it at least once. I might even do it a couple more times.

### The Experience

I really, *really* wanted to watch the new film **"Truy Tìm Long Diên Hương,"** but I couldn't find anyone with spare time to go with me. So, I thought, "Why can't I just go by myself?"

Honestly, it felt really weird at first. I had to tell myself it would be fine—people go places alone all the time, right?

When I arrived at the theater to line up for tickets, it was just couples, couples, and... more couples. There were some groups of friends mixed in, too. I grabbed my ticket, popcorn, and drink, and quickly ducked into the theater room.

### The "Sandwich" Situation

I sat in a row that was initially empty and thought, *"Wow, finally all alone."*

But I had chosen the middle row (**E6**)—the best seat in the house. A few minutes later, a group of friends sat on my left, and a couple sat on my right. And in between? There was me.

OMG. I immediately started overthinking: *When they realize I don't belong to either group, will they think I'm incapable of finding even one friend to go with?*

### The Verdict

Then, the movie started.

Surprisingly, I was **more focused** on the film than I usually am when I'm with someone. Although I did wish there was someone I could whisper to about the plot twists, it was still a cool experience.

If people think I'm weird, fine. I’m weird. But the movie was so good that I didn't mind being alone at all.

**In total:** Try it yourself. If you want to watch a movie, just go! You don't need to call someone or wait for a partner. It’s actually a great experience.
