## Saigon: The City I Love to Hate (And Hate to Love?)

So, a little background on me: I’m a Củ Chi kid, born and raised.
I lived in that suburban part of Saigon until the end of 9th grade,
which is when I decided to pack up and move to a `nội trú` (boarding)
school right in the heart of the city.

Because of that, I never really had the "normal" Saigonese schedule
. I wasn't part of the daily grind until I hit university.

### The Saigon Traffic Shock

Man, was I in for a shock. The first time I had to commute regularly,
I couldn't believe how people go to work, go to school, or just...
exist on the road. It is **total chaos**. A completely mess.

I honestly feel like just *surviving* the commute to school
or work exhausts all my energy for the entire day.

Which brings me to my main thought on Saigon:
It is **the worst place to live or work**. The traffic is just unbearable.

### The Nightlife Paradox

> *Nếu lúc đó là sáng sớm*

At night, Saigon is **so much fun**. There are endless places to hang out. 
It's awesome... you know, if you got the bag for all the fun stuff.

I've spent the last two years of uni trying *all* the fun and enjoyable places. 
Time flies when you're having fun, right? But lately, I've started to feel... empty.

My life has been stuck in this loop:
> Go to school -> Go home -> Wander to some random place.

That cycle has been on repeat until now.

### The "Bừng Tỉnh" Moment

Recently, I just... woke up. I had this `bừng tỉnh` (awakening) 
moment and a huge thought hit me:

**What next?! What am I supposed to do next?**

Now that I'm turning 20, I suddenly realize I want more.
I want *so many more* things out of my life.

So, I guess it’s time to find a job and start making some bread for my future.
I need to fund all this fulfillment I'm chasing.Maybe have a car or move to another country IDK LOL

Hope this little blog will keep all my life archived.
Whether I end up successful or not, looking back on all this when I'm older 
is going to be **Legendary**.
